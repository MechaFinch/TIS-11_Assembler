# TIS-11_Assembler
 An assembler for TIS-100 assembly to my own binary version, supporting both the game's format and my own
  
The definitions for the binary format and my own format can be found on my hard drive lmao  
they aren't likely to change but I'm not going to add them until I'm done programming this thing, cause at that point they'll be fully set in stone
